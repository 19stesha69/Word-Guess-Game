# Word-Guess-Game
Hangman-like word guess game

For coding bootcamp week 3 homework, I decided to challenge myself with the Word Guess Game.
The idea for this game is to rpesent the player with a word, expressed in dashed lines, and allow
them 10 chances to guess the word. When the word is guessed, a picture associated with the word will 
appear and music will play.

I chose to attempt this because I do have some past experience with JavaScript, and it project looked like it might be
manageable and I'd be able to produce a working application that looked good. Through working on this project, I became
more familiar with the onkeyup() event and was introduced to the includes() and push() methods. I was able, at one time, to
apply correct letters to the dashed line, and then, I was able to apply wrong choices to the HTML, as well as a correct count of 
wrong guesses. However, I lost my ability to add correct guesses to the dashed line and I'm unable to move from this point, 
at this moment. This is a project I want to see completed, so I will continue to look at ways to make this game functional.
